# Massage Gun Controller with STM32 and PWM

Welcome to my Massage Gun Controller project! This project combines the power of an STM32 microcontroller with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to deliver a customizable massage experience. By leveraging PWM, the STM32 configures the clock to control a servo motor that drives the massage gun’s percussive motion—letting you adjust intensity levels with precision.

## Key Highlights
- **STM32 Microcontroller & PWM**: The STM32 utilizes PWM to dynamically control motor speed, adjusting the strength and frequency of the massage for optimal comfort.
- **Oscilloscope Measurements**: An oscilloscope is used to measure and fine-tune the PWM signals, ensuring accurate control of the servo motor’s movement.
- **3D-Printed Components**: Custom parts are 3D printed to house and support the massage gun's mechanism, providing a durable and lightweight frame.
- **Servo Motor Control**: Using a servo motor, the system efficiently translates PWM signals into percussive motions, making the device both powerful and efficient.
- **Adjustable Intensity Levels**: Fine-tune the massage experience to your liking, whether you need a gentle massage or a deep muscle treatment.

This project is a fun dive into embedded systems, servo control, and 3D printing. It's been a great way to explore how all these elements come together to create a versatile device, and I hope to learn more.
